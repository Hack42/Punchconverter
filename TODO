Minimum requirements;

- This thing needs to convert codes between different types of punchtape readers and writers.
- All codes are convertable to ascii(?)
- Some codes, like "capslock", can change machine state.
- Input can be file, stdin or serial
- Output can be file, stdout or serial

Nice to have;

- Generic code, use config files for machines and add machines without coding (config files only)
- direct conversion, hook up two machines and make them talk to each other

Design.

[Machine]
  A class that converts ascii to machine specific data and vice versa.
  Reads a config file and optionally opens a serial port
  public methods;
    init(name, config, output) # initialise machine
    write(string) # Write to file or device
    read() # read from file or device
    open() # open output
    close() # close output
  private methods;
    state() # change state, shift etc.

Seems to me that Machine actually should inherit from the file class.

Hmm. After finishing the 1.0 version i read this file. 
Version 1.0 does not reflect the design above and is a clumsy, yet working python patch
